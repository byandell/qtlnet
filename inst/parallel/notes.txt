Parallelization of R/qtlnet using CHCT

The basic idea to create initial files offline
    cross.RData	  cross object with all needed genotypes and phenotypes
    params.txt	  parameter settings for Phase1

The cross.RData is Pscdbp.RData available in the data folder.

The skeleton for creating the offline files should be in qtlnet.phase0 but it is not written yet.
Basically, cross.RData should contain only needed data to conserve size, and should have
genoprobs already calculated. Best to do this in a staging directory so that there is a record
and it is reproducible.
