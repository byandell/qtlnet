R/qdg was a separate package, but is now folded into this package.
It depends on pcalg, which depends on ggm, which depends on gRbase.
The gRbase package depends on graph and RBGL, which are Bioconductor packages.
Use bioclite() to install graph and RBGL, then use install.packages() to install pcalg.
